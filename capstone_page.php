        <p>This particle simulator is a fun byproduct of  my capstone, which was about optimizing collision detection. I added the GUI controls for this demo. There is a zipped file of the full <a href="https://github.com/how1/capstone_unity_proj" target="_blank">Unity project</a> on my github, as well as another repository for just the <a href="https://github.com/how1/broad_phase_benchmark" target="_blank">code</a>. You can also read the <a href="Owen.Henry.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> I wrote.</p>
